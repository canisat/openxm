Linux/*NIX Platform Install Instructions:

	First off, you will need to make sure your Kernel is compiled
	with the following options:
	
	* Support for USB
	* Preliminary USB device filesystem
	* Your USB Host Controller Driver
	  (You will need to figgure out the one that works on your system)
	USB Serial Converter Support
	   * USB Generic Serial Driver 
	   * FTDI Single Port Serial Driver
	
	Then, you will need to make sure your USB Device Files are Created.
	Use mknod to create the following devices.  If you need more, just
	make them with incrementing minor numbers.
	
	$ mknod /dev/ttyUSB0 c 188 0 
	$ mknod /dev/ttyUSB1 c 188 1 
	$ mknod /dev/ttyUSB2 c 188 2 
	
	Execute the following:
	
	$ ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
	
	It should print this:
	
	crw-r--r--    1 root     root     188,   0 Jun  5 09:23 ttyUSB0
	crw-r--r--    1 root     root     188,   1 Jun  5 09:23 ttyUSB1
	crw-r--r--    1 root     root     188,   2 Jun  5 09:23 ttyUSB2
	
	You will want to make the devices writable by unprivileged users
	if you wish to run the program while not logged in as root.
	
	$ chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
	$ chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB1
	$ chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB2
	
	Reboot your system, install the modules if needed and grep dmesg
	for the folowing text:
	
	$ dmesg |grep FTDI
	
	usbserial.c: USB Serial support registered for FTDI SIO
	usbserial.c: USB Serial support registered for FTDI 8U232AM
	usbserial.c: FTDI 8U232AM converter detected
	usbserial.c: FTDI 8U232AM converter now attached to ttyUSB0 (or usb/tts/0 for devfs)
	ftdi_sio.c: v1.2.1:USB FTDI Serial Converters Driver
	
	Note which device the converter attaches to.  If you don't get 
	this message, try unplugging the XMPCR, and plugging it back in, 
	and regrep the dmesg.
	
	Once you know this device, you will be able to modify the XM2 file
	and get your unit working.  Open the file and scroll down until
	you find the following line:
	
	my $radio = XMPCR->new(port => '/dev/ttyUSB0');
	
	change the port to the port listed in the dmesg, and you should
	be good to go.

	
Running The Program:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should be able to run the program by executing ./ShellXM.  If it fails, check
the perl interpeter in the first line of the program and change as needed. 

It should power on the radio and tune to channel 1.  Type 'H' to see the commands
available to you.  Good Luck!

Please make sure you can get ShellXM running before trying the Client/Daemon Install.

1) Move xm.cgi & sleep.cgi to your webserver cgi-bin directory or other dir you
   can run scripts from.  Modify the script for your favorite channels by editing
   the @favorites line.  Add channels with coma's seperating the channels.  Update
   the $host variable by entering your computers host name.  Modify the Port if
   needed.  Copy the PNG's to your webservers base directory.

   If you want to use XMTracker with the Web Client, move XMTracker.pm into your
   cgi-bin directory also.

2) Update XMDaemon.  Change $allowed_ips to your webservers IP.  This is for
   authentication with xm.cgi.  Change the host to your hostname.  Change the
   $server_port if needed.
   
   $allowed_ips format:  my $allowd_ips = '(IP1|IP2|IP3|...)';

3) Run XMDaemon.  It should start up and give some logging notes.  Try to load
   xm.cgi on your webserver.  If all works out, you should see the button to turn
   the unit on.  If things do not work, check the logs.  it's probably an IP 
   thing =).
