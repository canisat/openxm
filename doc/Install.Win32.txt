| Install Instructions for Win32 Platforms |
+------------------------------------------+

You will need to download ActiveState's version of ActivePerl from:
http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/

After getting it installed, you will need a few modules:
	Win32-API
	TermReadKey
	Win32::SerialPort
	LWP::Simple (If you use XMTracker Module)
	
The first two are easy.  You can install them by going to a command prompt
and typing:
	'ppm install Win32-API'
	
This should go and fetch the files and install them.
After this, enter:
	'ppm install TermReadKey'
	
Now you should have these two installed, last you will need
to get Win32::SerialPort.  This one is a bit trickier.
	
The ZIP file is located in the 'extras' directory.
You can unzip this into a directory of your choice.  Enter the directory
and run the following commands:
	
	perl Makefile.PL
	perl install.pl
	
This should install the files.  Don't worry about perl test, some of the tests
will fail and that is expected.
	
Once you have these files installed, you should be able to run ShellXM without any
problems.
	
Running The Program:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should be able to run the program by executing 
	perl ShellXM

It should power on the radio and tune to channel 1.  Type 'H' to see the commands
available to you.  Good Luck!

Please make sure you can get ShellXM running before trying the Client/Daemon Install.

1) Move xm.cgi & sleep.cgi to your webserver cgi-bin directory or any other directory
   that you can execute scripts from.  Modify the script for your favorite channels by 
   editing the @favorites line in xm.cgi.  Add channels with comas seperating the 
   channels.  Update the $host variable by entering your computers host name.  This can
   be left as localhost for most installs.  If you are unsure, leave it.  Modify the Port 
   if needed (again, unnecessary under most circumstances).  Copy the PNG graphics to your 
   webservers base directory.

   If you want to use XMTracker with the Web Client, copy XMTracker.pm into your
   cgi-bin directory also.

2) Update XMDaemon.  Change $allowed_ips to your webservers IP.  This is for
   authentication with xm.cgi.  Change the $server_port if needed.
   
   $allowed_ips format:  my $allowd_ips = '(IP1|IP2|IP3|...)';

3) Run XMDaemon.  It should start up and give some logging notes.  Try to load
   xm.cgi on your webserver.  If all works out, you should see the button to turn
   the unit on.  If things do not work, check the logs.  it's probably an IP 
   thing =).
